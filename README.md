# Quant-Trading Repository

## Description

This repository serves as a collection of basic functions frequently used in quantitative trading. The goal is to provide reusable code snippets for calculating key financial and statistical metrics essential for quant trading.

## Features

The repository includes implementations of fundamental concepts such as:

- **Sharpe Ratio**: A measure of risk-adjusted return.
- **Drawdown**: The decline from a historical peak in a trading account.

These codes are designed to simplify the process of analyzing and evaluating trading strategies.

## Source of Concepts

The implementations are inspired by the teachings of Ernest P. Chan, as detailed in his influential books on quantitative trading. His work provides the foundation for the logic and methodology applied in this repository.

## Usage

To use any of the functions, clone the repository and import the relevant scripts into your Python project. Each function is written in Python and includes comments explaining how the code works, making it easy to understand and integrate into your workflow.
